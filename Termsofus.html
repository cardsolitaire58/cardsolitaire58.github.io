    <p class="c4 c20"><span>If you elect to seek arbitration or file a small claim court action, you must first send to
            us, by certified mail, a written notice of your claim (&ldquo;Notice&rdquo;). The Notice to us must be
            addressed to: [</span><span class="c22">400 ORCHARD ROAD #11-08 ORCHARD TOWERS SINGAPORE
            (238875)</span><span class="c5">]. If we initiate arbitration, we will send a written Notice to an email
            address you have previously provided to us, if available. We may also use any other means to contact you,
            including a message in your Account. A Notice, whether sent by you or by us, must (a) describe the nature
            and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (&ldquo;Demand&rdquo;). If
            you and we do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you
            or us may commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court. Arbitration forms can be
            downloaded from www.jamsadr.com. If you are required to pay a filing fee, after we receive Notice that you
            have commenced arbitration, we will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your
            claim is for greater than US$10,000 or the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous, in which event
            you will be responsible for filing fees.</span></p>
    <p class="c4 c20"><span class="c2">Hearing:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;If your claim is for US$10,000 or less, we
            agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents
            submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic or video hearing, or by an in-person hearing as
            established by the JAMS Rules. If your claim exceeds US$10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by
            the JAMS Rules. In the event that the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of submitted
            documents, the arbitrator&rsquo;s decision and award will be made and delivered within six (6) months of the
            selection of the arbitrator, unless extended by the arbitrator. Except as expressly set forth herein, the
            payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules.</span></p>
    <p class="c4 c20"><span class="c2">Award:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;In the event arbitration awards you damages
            of an amount at least $100 greater than our last documented settlement offer, we will pay your awarded
            damages or $2,500, whichever is greater.</span></p>

            you and we both agree that you or we may sue in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual
            property rights or in other scenarios where injunctive relief is appropriate. In the event a court or
            arbitrator having jurisdiction finds any portion of these Terms unenforceable, that portion shall not be
            effective and the remainder of these Terms shall remain effective. No waiver, express or implied, by either
            party of any breach of or default under these Terms will constitute a continuing waiver of such breach or

            necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as may be necessary in

            respect to applicable substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of these Terms shall
            be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C., Secs. 1-16). In any arbitration arising out of or
            related to these Terms, the arbitrator is not empowered to award punitive or exemplary damages, except where
            permitted by statute, and the parties waive any right to recover any such damages. In any arbitration
            arising out of or related to these Terms, the arbitrator may not award any incidental, indirect or
            consequential damages, including damages for lost profits. The parties adopt and agree to implement the JAMS
            Optional Arbitration Appeal Procedure (as it exists on the effective date of this Agreement) with respect to
            any final award in an arbitration arising out of or related to these Terms. &nbsp;</span></p>
